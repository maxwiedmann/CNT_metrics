Problem statement: Analyzing CNT TEM images is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. The number of

Have images with and without labeled diameters

Message from Steven:

"
within each batch code there is the raw images, then a folder called measurements inside which is a histogram of the diameters along with the same images as before but with the manual measurment imprinted 

There are three codes that might be of use, if the batch name starts with AX or LX diameters should be 2-3 nm and CNTs are single walled.  If its TF then diameters could be more like 5+ nm and some are double walled. 
If a particular type of image is most helpful let me know and I can try to find more of that type. 

my guess is the TF images will be easier to analyze, but we have less of them
also as a suggestion, you dont need to identify all the tubes, especially in the messy overlapping areas.  If the program could just identify a handful of nice tubes from each image that would already be awesome
